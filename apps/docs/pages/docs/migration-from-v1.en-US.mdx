# How to migrate from V1

Migration from V1 to V2 introduces some breaking changes to take in account.
V2 contains a huge refactoring of the library to improve the quality and possibilities of the library use.

Here, you can find the recap of all the breaking changes. If you have any issue during the update to V2, please open an issue on Github repository.

## FicusProvider

`ThemeProvider` becomes `FicusProvider`

## New theme structure

Ficus UI V2 brings new theme structure, please update your custom theme following instructions <Link href="/docs/customization">here</Link>.

Also, new theme introduces variants and sizes customization to apply different styles for each config.

## Switch component

`Switch` component has been refactored, now prop `on` becomes `isChecked`.

## Button component

`prefix` and `suffix` props have been removed from `Button` component, now we can pass directly in children the prefix and suffix.

For example :

```js
<Button colorScheme="green">
    <Icon name="heart" color={useColorModeValue('white', 'gray.800')} size="xl" mr="sm" />
    Button
</Button>
```

Also, as for inputs, the style and size of `Button` has been slightly changed.

## Select component

Select component has been totally changed to use the library https://github.com/lawnstarter/react-native-picker-select.
Now the component has a more "native" approach than the previous select modal component in V1.
