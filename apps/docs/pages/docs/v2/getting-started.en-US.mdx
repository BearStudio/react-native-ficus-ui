# Get started

## Requirements

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This library now needs `react-native-gesture-handler` to be installed inside the React Native project.
  If you use Expo Go then you have nothing to do as Gesture Handler is integrated inside Expo SDK.
  But if you use a Bare React Native project, please follow those instructions in first : https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation/
</Callout>

## Installation

With pnpm :

```sh
pnpm add react-native-ficus-ui
```

With npm :

```sh
npm install react-native-ficus-ui
```

With yarn :

```sh
yarn add react-native-ficus-ui
```

Then, install the pods for iOS :

```sh
cd ios && pod install
```

## Usage

You need to wrap your root component inside ThemeProvider component from react-native-ficus-ui.

```js
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'react-native-ficus-ui';

import App from './src/App';

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => Main);
```
