# ficus()

Ficus UI V2 brings now a new method ficus() to custom any React Native component with Ficus UI style props.

For example here we create a component `CustomView` that is a red circle `View` from React Native. 

```js
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { ficus } from 'react-native-ficus-ui';

export const CustomView = ficus(View, {
  baseStyle: {
    borderRadius: 'full',
    bg: 'red'
  },
});
```
